# Erc20_PHP_implementation
This project is providing implementation of Erc20 tokens functionality in php.

As we see that ERC20 token functions are not available in php implementation. So to help Blockchain developers i have made this project.

* Get Balance of any erc20 token
* Get full name of any erc20 token
